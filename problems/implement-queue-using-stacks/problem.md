# Implement Queue using Stacks

Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, pop, peek, empty).

Implement the MyQueue class:
* `push(x)` Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
* `pop()` Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
* `peek()` Returns the element at the front of the queue.
* `empty()` Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.

Notes:
* You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means you can only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
* Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

## Example 1:
```
Input
["MyQueue", "push", "push", "peek", "pop", "empty"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, 1, false]
Explanation
MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
myQueue.push(1); // queue is: [1]
myQueue.push(2); // queue is: [1, 2] (leftmost is front of the queue)
myQueue.peek(); // return 1
myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is [2]
myQueue.empty(); // return false

```
## Constraints:

* `1 <= x <= 9`
* At most `100` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `empty`.
* All the calls to `pop` and `peek` are valid.
